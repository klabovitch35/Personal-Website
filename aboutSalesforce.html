                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Professionally, I never thought I would end up in the position that I am in today.
                        I entered Brandeis University in the Fall of 2013, intending to double major in both
                        Business and Politics. My main passions lay in the political realm, as I had worked on
                        Presidential campaigns in high school canvassing for President Barack Obama. However, after
                        a fateful internship in Washington DC in which I got to help lobby to pass a resolution
                        through a divided Congress, I realized that I did not want to work in such a broken system
                        as a full time career. Another internship in Marketing led me to conclude that it was also
                        not the best path for me. Coming in to the fall of my Senior year at Brandeis University, I did
                        not know what I wanted to do, but after sending out a flurry of applications I was able to
                        secure my place in State Street's "Future Focus" class of 2017, a program designed to recruit
                        recent college grads and prepare them for a career at State Street.

                    <p>
                        Wanting to bring a tangible skill to my first job, I did research on the most desirable skills
                        in the market, and found that Salesforce expertise was at the top of most people's lists. After hearing
                        that State Street used Salesforce, I locked myself in my dorm room for a couple months, and was able
                        to pass the Administrator and Platform App Builder certification exams. I did this through online
                        video courses and study guides at Udemy.com and Forcus on Force.com. After finding that State Street
                        wasn't willing to grant me a license to work on their platform, I was able to leverage my certificaitons
                        into a new job as a Salesforce Business Analyst at a small tech company, working as a business analyst. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While at my job, I was the junior analyst, working underneath a more experienced Salesforce Administrator.
                        However, after 3 months she left the job, leaving in charge of the company's Salesforce org, with little
                        experience under my belt. Through immersing myself in all aspects of salesforce I was able to pick up 2 more
                        certifications on the platform, the Sales Cloud Consultant and Advanced Administrator badges. However, I found
                        that to tackle more complex business problems, the declarative (non code) features offered by the platform were
                        somewhat limited. I found that I could find solutions through taking basic code from the internet and modifying it
                        for my own purposes. Eventually I started to write my own code, and was able to pass the Developer certification exam. 
                        This allowed me to get an even better job as a Salesforce Developer at a large company, which I have thoroughly enjoyed.
                        This is how I was able to take my politics degree and get a job as a Software Developer 14 months!
